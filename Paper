Abstract 


 
	Beginning early in infancy – and perhaps even before birth – humans can represent approximate numerical quantities nonverbally (Schleger et al., 2014; Izard et al., 2009; Xu & Spelke, 2000), using what is sometimes called the “Approximate Number System” (ANS) or “number sense” (Dehaene, 1997). The ANS allows organisms to compare and represent numerical quantities, and these numerical abilities are governed by Weber’s law, such that the ratio of any two numerical quantities determines the precision with which they can be differentiated (cites). Interestingly, individual differences in ANS acuity (Xu & Spelke, 2000; Halberda et al., 2012) have been reported to predict mathematics achievement, such that individuals with greater ANS acuity also perform better on standardized math tests, the SAT, and a host of other math measures (Chen & Li, 2014). These findings are exciting for at least two reasons. First, they suggest a link between the evolutionarily ancient ANS and the more recent human innovation of symbolic arithmetic, thus providing insight into the origins of mathematical thought. Second, the findings suggest that tests of ANS acuity may be helpful in designing diagnostic and intervention tools for early math difficulties (Park & Brannon, 2013; 2014; Starr et al., 2013), perhaps even before children begin formal math training.
More than a dozen studies have reported a relation between the ANS and symbolic math, and this predictive relation often survives the addition of non-numerical control predictors, like verbal SAT score, IQ, and spelling ability (e.g., Anobile, Stievano, & Burr, 2013; Bonny & Lourenco, 2013; Desoete et al., 2012; deWind & Brannon, 2012; DeStefano & LeFevre, 2004; Geary, 2011; Gilmore et al., 2010; Halberda, Mazzocco, & Feigenson, 2008; Halberda et al., 2012; Mazzocco et al., 2011a;b; Libertus et al., 2011; Libertus, Odic, & Halberda, 2012; Libertus, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2013; Piazza et al., 2010; Starr, Libertus, & Brannon, 2013; St Clair-Thompson & Gathercole, 2006). However, many other studies have found the relation between ANS acuity and symbolic math ability to be negligibly small or even absent, especially when controlling for other non-numerical cognitive skills like inhibitory control, symbolic number knowledge, and non-numerical quantity comparison (e.g., Fuhs & McNeil, 2013; Gobel et al., 2014; Holloway & Ansari, 2009; Inglis et al., 2011; Kolkman et al., 2013; Nosworthy et al., 2013; Price et al., 2012; Sasanguie, De Smedt, Defever, & Reynvoet, 2012; Sasanguie, Defever, Maertens, & Reynvoet, 2014; Sasanguie et al., 2013; Tibber et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2012). These discrepant findings raise important questions about the nature and practical significance of any relationship between the ANS and symbolic math success (for review, see De Smedt, Noel, Gilmore, & Ansari, 2013).
One way to adjudicate between these discrepant findings is via meta-analysis. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that – across a wide range of study methodologies and samples – ANS acuity explained substantial variability in symbolic math achievement (Chen & Li, 2014). However, fully half of the studies included in the meta-analysis did not control for participants’ non-numerical cognitive capacities, and the vast majority of those that did only controlled for participants’ linguistic ability. This inconsistent selection of control tasks is a problem, because tasks typically used to measure ANS acuity – e.g., dot array comparison – likely draw on a host of non-numerical cognitive capacities, like working memory, non-numerical quantity representation, and inhibitory control. Critically, each of these cognitive capacities has also been shown to support early math achievement, making it possible that they directly mediate correlations between ANS acuity and math achievement (Alloway & Passolunchi, 2011; Clark, Pritchard, & Woodward, 2010; Gilmore et al., 2013; Link, Nuerk, & Moeller, 2014; Lourenco, Bonny, Fernandez, & Rao, 2012; Thompson, Nuerk, Moeller, & Cohen Kadosh, 2013). In sum, although reported correlations between ANS acuity and math achievement may be due to a unique relationship between verbal and nonverbal numerical abilities, it is also possible that other, non-numerical perceptual and cognitive capacities explain the reported correlations.  
	While the existing literature leaves open whether a unique and robust relationship exists between ANS acuity and mathematics achievement, it also leaves open the question of why such a relationship might exist in the first place. One possibility is that ANS acuity directly impacts the precision of arithmetic computations because it is necessary for the acquisition and processing of symbolic number. To test this direct mediation hypothesis, three recent studies have asked whether training on non-verbal numerical tasks improves mathematics performance (Obersteiner, Reiss, & Ufer, 2013; Park & Brannon, 2013; 2014). Unfortunately, as in the case of previous correlational studies, results were again mixed: Obersteiner et al., (2013) found no selective transfer from non-verbal number training to verbal math skill, while Park and Brannon (2013; 2014) did report transfer in adult subjects. 
A second possibility is that ANS acuity impacts math achievement indirectly, via links between values in the ANS and number words in the verbal count list.

One possibility is children actually recruit the ANS when doing symbolic math, or can use the ANS to check their answers while performing arithmetic (e.g., Huttenlocher et al., 1994; Gilmore et al., 2007). This view would predict that estimation performance (the ability to map number language onto ANS representations of quantity) might mediate any relation between the ANS and mathematics achievement. In support of the view that estimation ability relates to estimation success, several recent studies have shown that estimation ability predicts math achievement (cites from below), and one recent study has provided evidence that estimation ability mediates the relation between the ANS and math success (Libertus, Odic, Feigenson, & Brannon, 2015). 
Of course, it is possible to predict a relation between estimation ability and math achievement that exists for reasons that unrelated to the acuity of the ANS. Some have argued that estimation relies heavily on structure mapping: the analogical connection of two distinct systems (the ANS and the verbal number system) on the basis of their shared structure (Izard & Dehaene, 2008; Sullivan & Barner, 2012; 2014a). It’s possible that estimation and symbolic math achievement could be mutually predictive because both estimation and symbolic math require an understanding of the structure of the symbolic number system (e.g., an understanding of place-value and the relative distance between numbers),  (Sullivan & Barner, 2014b). Consistent with this, many number-line estimation tasks predict math achievement (cites from below), even through number-line estimation doesn’t draw on the ANS (Siegler & Opfer, 2003; Sullivan & Barner, 2014b). However, current research on the relation between estimation ability and math achievement faces many of the same challenges as work on the ANS (e.g., weak or inconsistent controls and correlational designs). 
In the present study, we had two main goals. Our first goal was to test whether there is a unique, causal relation between ANS acuity and mathematics achievement, or whether previously reported correlations are explained by individual differences in domain general cognitive capacities (like spatial working memory). Our second goal was to test whether there is a unique relation between estimation performance and math achievement, and if so, whether such a relation mediate (or is mediated by) ANS.  
To test these questions, we analyzed data from a three-year-long longitudinal randomized controlled math intervention in 2nd- through 5th graders (n = 204). This study, described by Barner et al. (under review), manipulated the mathematics ability of an experimental group via supplemental training in a popular mental arithmetic technique called “mental abacus” (Frank & Barner, 2012; all others). This technique improved participants’ math abilities above and beyond a control standard math curriculum (). At each of four time points, children’s ANS acuity was tested, and at three times points, their estimation ability was tested. In addition, children’s cognitive capacities were measured a four time points via tests of spatial working memory, verbal working memory, and mental rotation, as well as a test of general intelligence. 
Method
Participants
Participants were 204 children from a charitable school in Gujarat, India. Children spoke English (the language of instruction at their school), and most children also spoke an additional language (Guajarti and Hindi were the most common). When we enrolled participants in the study (Year 0), children were between the ages of 5 and 7. At enrollment, we randomly assigned participants to classrooms where they would receive one of two curricula: a standard international math curriculum or mental abacus instruction: 100 participants were assigned to the mental abacus group and 104 to the control group. Of these, the vast majority provided data for every year of testing (Years 0-3; Control group n = 88; Mental Abacus group n = 99). 
Math Measures
	We had several measures of math competency: Performance on in-house arithmetic and place value tasks; math grades; performance on the Woodcock Johnson III Computation test, and performance on the Math Fluency subtest of the Weschler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT-III). These measures allowed us to assess the efficacy of our intervention, and to quantify children’s math achievement.
Intervention 
	As described elsewhere (Barner et al., under review), children in both curricular groups participated in standard math class throughout the 3 years of the study. In addition, each group had three hours of supplemental math instruction: the control group received a standard math curriculum, while the mental abacus group learned to use a mental abacus. 
Critically, our mental abacus intervention was effective in causing improvements to math skill. Children in the abacus group outperformed those in the control group: by Year 3, there were significant differences in math performance between the two groups on a standardized math test (the calculation substest of the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Acheivement – the WJ-IIIC) and in-house arithmetic assessments, and longitudinal growth models revealed an effect of abacus training over time on these measures (Barner et al., under review). Critically, abacus training did not improve any other of our tested cognitive measures, and did not alter participants’ attitudes towards math. 
To test whether math training causes changes to the ANS and estimation ability, we will therefore compared the ANS and estimation abilities of participants who completed the (successful) mental abacus intervention to the control group. 
ANS and Estimation Tasks
	We tested participants’ ANS acuity using a short computerized task. Two arrays of black dots were presented simultaneously on a gray background; the two arrays were separated by a vertical black line. On half of the trials, we controlled for total surface area across the arrays; on the other half of trials, we controlled for item size (Dehaene et al., 2005). The correct answer was on the left 50% of the time. 
Arrays were visible for 1000 ms., and were followed by 300 ms. of random noise. Participants were instructed to indicate which array was more numerous by pressing the Z (which had been covered with a left arrow) or M (which had been covered by a right arrow) key. The experiment was self-paced, and the participant pressed the space-bar to progress to the next trial. To ensure that participants attended to each trial, two beeps were presented via headphones immediately prior to the presentation of the arrays. 
Trials were presented in “blocks” of 8. Within each block, the ratio of items in the two sets remained constant; all participants started with a 4:5 ratio. In each block, the numerical magnitudes of the arrays varied substantially (e.g., 16 vs. 20; 80 vs. 100). Side of the correct response was pseudo-randomly ordered so that alternating responses or consistent choices of “left” or “right” would lead to failure of the block. In order to succeed on a given block, the participant needed to get 6 out of 8 trials correct. If they succeeded on a block, they moved to the next hardest ratio (e.g., 5:6), while if they failed, they moved to the next easiest ratio (e.g., 3:4). 
We tested participants’ estimation ability by presenting randomly generated arrays of black dots on gray background. The number of dots ranged from x-x, and dot size and total area of the array varied across trials. Participants viewed each array for x ms, and then entered their numerical estimate on a keypad. Prior to beginning the task, children completed a keypad typing training session to ensure that all participants could appropriately use the keypad. 	
Control Tasks
	We tested participants on a host of control tasks, described in detail elsewhere (Barner et al., under review). We tested participants on two computerized measures of working memory (verbal working memory, which required recalling a sequence of syllables in the correct order; and spatial working memory, which required recalling a sequence of dot-locations in the correct order). We also tested participants on a paper-and-pencil task measuring mental rotation ability. Finally, we tested participants using Raven’s Progressive Matrices. 
Results
ANS and Estimation Measures 
We calculated participants’ ANS acuity each year (Year 0, 1, 2, and 3) as a Weber fraction (Halberda, Mazzocco, & Feigenson, 2008). Better ANS acuity is indicated by a smaller Weber fraction (Macuity Y0 = .37; Y1 = .18; Y2 = .15; Y3 = .14).
We also had several measures of estimation ability, and each measure represented slightly different numerical skills. We calculated each measure for years 1, 2, and 3 (we did not collect Year 0 estimation data). First, we computed the linear r2 for each participant (cite). To do this, we constructed a linear regression predicting each participant’s estimates from the number of dots presented, and then reported the linear r2 of the line (Y1 = .37; Y2 = .35; Y3 = .36). Linear r2 represents the amount of variability in estimation performance that can be accounted for by knowing the number of dots a child was estimating – in other words, this value represents the extent to which hthe relation between a child’s estimate and the number of dots that they saw can be described by a linear function (in previous work, this has been referred to as the “linearty” of children’s estimates; e.g., Booth & Siegler, 2006). Importantly, a high linear r2 score does not necessarily indicate that a participant provided accurate estimates, but rather that their estimates were internally consistent. High levels of internal consistency in estimation could emerge either through the possession of accurate and stable mappings between number words and the values they represent or through an internally consistent structure mapping (Sullivan & Barner, 2014). In number-line estimation tasks, linear r2 has been shown repeatedly to correlate with symbolic math performance (Gunderson, Ramirez, Beilock, & Levine, 2012; Kolkman et al., 2013; Moore & Ashcraft, 2015; Siegler & Booth, 2004; Booth & Siegler, 2006; 2008). 
We also calculated Proportion Absolute Error (PAE; the absolute value of the deviation of an estimate from the actual number presented, divided by the number presented), which represents the accuracy of the estimates (MPAE: Y1 = .71; Y2 = .71; Y3 = 70). PAE has been shown previously to predict math performance on standardized tests (Siegler & Booth, 2004, Castronovo & Göbel, 2012; although not across all studies; Booth & Siegler, 2006), addition/subtraction performance (Link, Nuerk, and Moeller, 2014; Moore & Ashcraft, 2015 [addition only]), and mental arithmetic (Lyons, Price, Vaessen, Blomert, & Ansari, 2014). Thus, if possessing highly accurate and stable mappings between number words and nonverbal representations of number is important to math success (e.g., in the case that children actually recruit the ANS to check or compute symbolic math calculations), then PAE should be related to math performance. 
Finally, we calculated the ordinality of participants’ estimates (Sullivan & Barner, 2014a; 2014b). This measure is calculated by coding each trial for whether it is in the correct direction relative to the immediately preceding trial. For example, if a smaller number of dots is shown on trial n than on trial n-1, a child’s estimate is labeled as ordinal if their estimate is smaller on trial n than on trial n-1. We then calculated each participant’s average rate of ordinal responding for each year (Mordinality: Y1 = .80; Y2 = .80; Y3 = .80). Previous work has shown that children provide ordinal estimates even in cases where their estimates were highly inaccurate, and it has been argued that ordinality scores track participants’ understanding of the structural relations between the verbal and nonverbal number systems (e.g., even a participant who doesn’t know how many objects forty should refer to might know to use forty only to label larger sets than those labeled by ten). Thus, if understanding the structural relation between the verbal and nonverbal number systems is important to early math success, then ordinality might be importantly related to math outcomes.
Reliability was relatively good for all of our measures. To approximate reliability, we predicted Year N’s data from Year N-1; we report the correlation coefficients in Table 1.
Table 1. Year-to-year reliability for each of our estimation and ANS measures.
 
Math Measures
	As described above, we had a number of dependent variables that quantified math achievement. In what follows, we quantified math achievement in three ways. First, we used our abacus intervention as one measure of math skill: we did this by comparing the estimation and ANS acuity of participants who learned abacus (and who therefore improved at math) to the control group. This allowed us to ask whether improving math performance caused improvements to ANS and estimation outcomes. 
Second, we created a composite of the standardized math test scores (WIAT and WJ-III), and predicted this composite from ANS and estimation measures. This measure showed improved scores each year of testing (Mstandardized: Y0 = .20; Y1 = .31; Y2 = .43; Y3 = .54). 
Finally, we conducted a Principle Components Analysis on all of our symbolic math measures (WIAT, WJ-III, arithmetic, place value, math grades) in order to find   a single measure that indexed math skill. We then predicted this measure – PC1 – from ANS and estimation performance. 
Effect of Intervention on ANS and Estimation
	We first tested whether our intervention influenced ANS acuity and Estimation performance. To test this, we predicted ANS acuity from a model containing Year (to test whether ANS performance improved over time), Intervention Condition (abacus vs. no abacus), their interaction term, with a growth term capturing each participant’s growth over time (year|participant). If getting better at math causes improvements to the ANS, then this should result in a significant Year * Intervention interaction, such that participants who received abacus training (and therefore got better at math) showed larger improvements in and acuity over time than participants in the control group.  We found an effect of year, suggesting that participants’ ANS acuity improved over time (B = -.07, SE  = .03) but we found no effect of condition (B = -.02, SE = .01) or interaction of condition and time (B = .006, SE = .007, p > .3).  Planned t-tests also revealed no effects of abacus training on ans in years 1 (t(179) = -.20, p = .84), 2 (t(183)=-.34, p = .74), or 3 (t(183) = -1.26. p =.26; Fig. 1). 
 
Figure 1. Difference across intervention conditions in estimation performance by year (1, 2, and 3 – we did not test estimation in year 0), and for ans (years 0, 1, 2, and 3). For our Linear r2 and Ordinality measures, bigger numbers indicate better performance; for Proportion Absolute Error and ans measures, smaller numbers indicate better performance. Error bars are SEM.
	We next tested whether our intervention influenced Estimation performance. Because we did not have Year 0 (baseline) data, we could not assess with certainty whether abacus training caused changes to Estimation. However, we could test for whether there were differences in Estimation performance between the abacus and control group during years 1, 2, and 3. To summarize, we found that no estimation measure showed consistent (e.g., across more than one year) differences between the abacus and control group. And, when correcting for multiple comparisons, no p-value reached significance. For PAE, there was no effect of abacus training in year 1 (t(182) = -1.64, p = .10), an effect in year 2 (t(185) = -2.21, p = .03; Bonferroni p =.09), and no effect in year 3 (t(184) = -1.47, p = .14). For ordinality, there was an effect in year 1 (t(182) = 2.15, p = .03; Bonferroni p =.10), and no effect in years 2 and 3 (year 2: t(185) = 1.39, p = .17; year 3: t(184)=1.12, p = .26). For linear r2, there was no effect in years 1 or 2 (year 1: t(182) = .598, p = .55; year 2: t(185) = .38, p =.71), but there was an effect in year 3 (t(184)=2.34, p =.02; Bonferroni p = .06). While our results clearly trended in the correct direction (e.g., a visual inspection of Fig. 1 shows mean differences in ans and estimation performance between conditions, for years 1-3), none of these comparisons reached significance. Thus, it appears as though an intervention that successfully led to improved math outcomes did not lead to consistent gains in ANS acuity or estimation ability.  
Relation Between Math Achievement, Estimation, and the ANS
	While the previous analyses suggest that an intervention that improves math performance did not necessarily also improve ANS acuity or estimation performance, a second goal of this study was to understand whether ANS acuity and estimation performance predict math success more generally. 
To begin to answer this question, we constructed a model predicting standardized math scores from ANS acuity, for each year separately. This model represents the sort of simple correlation that is typical in studies relating ANS acuity to math achievement (cite), in that it asks whether it is possible to use ANS skill to concurrently predict math success. For this and all subsequently reported models, we z-scored all predictors; for this reason, we report standardized beta weights and standard errors for all analyses. In this way, it is possible to directly compare the relative predictive value of each parameter in the models. For univariate analyses, we report p-values from simple correlations; for multivariate analyses, we report p-values from follow-up likelihood ratio tests.  
	As with previous research, we found that ANS acuity was a concurrent predictor of standardized math scores (pANS: Y0=.0002; Y1= .02; Y2 =.16; Y3 =.002). Similarly, each of our estimation measures concurrent predicted standardized math scores in Years 2 and 3 (pPAE: Y1 = .32; Y2 = .05; Y3 = .002; pLinearR2: Y1 = .17; Y2 = .001; Y3 = .0001; pOrdinality: Y1 = .99; Y2 = .005; Y3 = .002). In addition, across nearly all measure and years, ANS and estimation measures were concurrent predictors of our PC1, which was an index of general math performance (pANS: Y0=.0002; Y1= .07; Y2 =.04; Y3 =.0003; pPAE: Y1 = .02; Y2 = .01; Y3 = .0007; pLinearR2: Y1 = .03; Y2 = .0008; Y3 < .0001; pOrdinality: Y1 = .16; Y2 = .01; Y3 = .0001). Thus, as with previous work, we show strong evidence that both ANS acuity and estimation performance predict concurrent math success. 
	We next predicted the same math outcomes (our standardized test composite and PC1) from our numerical predictors (ANS and estimation performance), while controlling for a host of non-numerical measures (mental rotation, spatial WM, verbal WM, Raven’s, age, and whether the participant was in the control or intervention group). We constructed one model per year, per predictor. This allowed us to ask whether the above-reported correlations between ANS, estimation ability, and math outcomes represent a privileged predictive relation, or, instead, whether they might be better explained by other, non-numerical predictors. While measures like Raven’s, Mental Rotation, and our Intervention relatively consistently predicted standardized math scores (Fig. 2), the predictive value of our ANS and estimation measures were far less consistent. For example, when controlling for non-numerical tasks, ANS only significantly predicted standardized test scores in year 0 (B = -.24, SE = .08, p = .003, all other p>.05). Linear r2 and PAE never significantly predicted standardized test scores (all p>.05; but see Figure 2 for some evidence that Linear r2 may have some predictive power), and ordinality only predicted standardized test scores in Year 2 (B =  .15, SE = .07, p = .04). 
Additional linear growth models (conducted only on ANS data, since we did not have Year 0 Estimation data) revealed that ANS was a significant predictor of growth in math performance (B = -.07, SE = .03, p = .01), as was year, Intervention, Mental Rotation, Raven’s, and Verbal Working Memory (all p<.05). However, while ANS was a significant predictor of growth in standardized test scores, the effect was tiny, and disappeared when using a time-lagged measure of ANS (stats). 

 
Figure 2. Standardized Beta weights (bars are standard error) when predicting standardized math scores from each of our predictors (ANS, PAE, Linear r2, and Ordinality), controlling for other non-numerical tasks.
 
	When predicting PC1 from ANS, estimation measures, and our control tasks, we found similar results. Raven’s, Mental Rotation, our Intervention, and Verbal Working Memory all predicted PC1 relatively consistently. Again, ANS performance significantly predicted PC1, but only in Year 0 (B = .19, SE = .08, p=.02; all other p>.05). Neither ordinality nor PAE ever predicted PC1 when controlling for other factors (all p>.05; but see Figure 3 for some evidence that Ordinality may have had predictive value). Interestingly, Linear r2 did significantly predict PC1 in both Year 2 (B =  .19, SE =.07, p = .007) and Year 3 (B = .17, SE = .07, p = .008), though not in Year 1 (p>.05).

Discussion
	In the present study, we tested whether nonverbal number (ANS) acuity and verbal estimation ability were related to symbolic math success. New to this study, we assessed whether (1) improvements to math performance caused changes to ANS acuity and math skill; (2) relations between math performance, ANS, and estimation were consistent over time; and (3) relations between math performance, ANS, and estimation persisted even when controlling for performance on a host of non-numerical control tasks. To test these questions, we conducted a successful 3-year-long randomized controlled math intervention (which led to our intervention group improving substantially at math relative to the control group), and collected yearly data on each of our measures of interest. This allowed us to test both causal and longitudinal questions about the relation between formal math skill and informal numeracy measures. 
	Consistent with past research (cites), we found that both ANS acuity and estimation performance served as concurrent predictors of math success. However, unlike previous studies, we found that this predictive relation was attenuated substantially when other, non-numerical predictors were included in the model. In fact, measures like Raven’s, Mental Rotation, and verbal working memory nearly always equaled or outperformed our estimation and ANS measures in predicting math performance. Because ANS and estimation tasks require nonverbal comparison, spatial skills, and memory, it may be the case that these tasks have previously been reported to be related to math skill in part because they also measure non-numerical cognitive and perceptual ability.
